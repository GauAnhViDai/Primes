                =================================

Unix-like operating systems
===========================

Download the latest release tarball from
https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/releases and uncompress it.
Then open a terminal and build and install primesieve using:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

If you cloned primesieve's git repository or downloaded its master
branch then you need to first generate the configure script yourself.
In order to do this you need to have installed GNU Autotools and 
Libtool. You can then generate the configure script using:

$ ./autogen.sh

By default the example programs are not built. If you also want to
build the example programs then you have to enable them in the
configure step:

$ ./configure --enable-examples

If you want to build primesieve using a specific compiler or if you
want to use custom compiler flags you can do this using e.g.:

$ ./configure CXX=icpc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -openmp"

Microsoft Visual C++
====================

Download the latest primesieve source archive from
https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/releases and uncompress it.
Then open a Visual Studio Command Prompt and `cd' into the newly
created directory and run:

> nmake -f Makefile.msvc
> nmake -f Makefile.msvc examples

The second command is optional, it builds the example programs.

On Windows your CPU's L1 data cache size cannot be detected
automatically, the default L1 data cache size in primesieve is 32
kilobytes. If your CPU has a different L1 data cache size then you
should indicate it in order to get the best performance e.g.:

> nmake -f Makefile.msvc L1_DCACHE_SIZE=64
