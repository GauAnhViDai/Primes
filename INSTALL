Unix-like operating systems
===========================

Download the latest release tarball from
http://primesieve.org/downloads and uncompress it. Then open a
terminal and build and install primesieve using:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

If you cloned primesieve's git repository or downloaded its master
branch then you need to have installed GNU Autotools and Libtool
to build it:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

On some operating systems e.g. Solaris the configure script is unable
to detect (prints warning) the CPU's L1 data cache size.
If you want the best performance you need to set your CPU's L1 data
cache size in kilobytes manually using e.g.:

$ ./configure L1_DCACHE_SIZE=64

By default the configure script sets the sieve size to your CPU's L1
data cache size. You can set the sieve size to another value (in
kilobytes) using e.g.:

$ ./configure SIEVESIZE=256

By default the example programs are not built. If you also want to
build the example programs then you have to enable them in the
configure step:

$ ./configure --enable-examples

If you want to build primesieve using a specific compiler or if you
want to use custom compiler flags you can do this using e.g.:

$ make CXX=my_compiler CXXFLAGS="-O2"

Cygwin & MinGW
==============

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

After that you need to add /usr/local/lib to the library path:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH

Microsoft Visual C++
====================

Download the latest primesieve source archive from
http://primesieve.org/downloads and uncompress it. Then open a Visual
Studio Command Prompt and `cd' into the newly created directory and
run:

> nmake -f Makefile.msvc
> nmake -f Makefile.msvc examples

The second command is optional, it builds the example programs.

On Windows your CPU's L1 data cache size cannot be detected
automatically, the default L1 data cache size in primesieve is 32
kilobytes. If your CPU has a different L1 data cache size then you
should indicate it in order to get the best performance e.g.:

> nmake -f Makefile.msvc L1_DCACHE_SIZE=64
