About
=====

  primesieve does not use any assembly but if the following ASM
  instructions ever become part of standard C++ they would be useful
  and provide minor speed ups:

  1. POPCNT
  ---------
  The POPCNT instruction can be used to count primes (1 bits in the
  sieve array), x86 CPUs support POPCNT since 2010 (SSE4.2).
  Currently primesieve counts primes using an "integer arithmetic" bit
  population count algorithm, see src/soe/popcount.cpp.

  2. BSF
  ------
  The BSF (bit scan forward) instruction is available on x86 CPUs
  since 1985 but unfortunately not available in standard C++. On other
  CPU architectures this instruction is sometimes called CTZ (count
  trailing zeros). The BSF instruction can be used to quickly find the
  next prime i.e. 1 bit in the sieve array.
