Q  I want to generate primes > 2^64, is it possible to extend
   primesieve to 128 bits?

A  Technically it is possible but it makes no sense due to the
   enormous memory requirement. primesieve uses the segmented sieve of
   Eratosthenes which uses O(pi(n^0.5)) memory, e.g. near 10^25
   primesieve would need ~ 1300 GB (gigabytes) per thread!
   J. Sorenson's paper "The Pseudosquares Prime Sieve" presents an
   algorithm that can be used to generate primes up to 33 digits
   using very little memory.


Q  What are small, medium and big sieving primes?

A  In primesieve sieving primes fall into 3 categories: small, medium
   and big sieving primes, these categories correlate with the size of
   the sieve array. In primesieve small sieving primes are <= (sieve
   size in bytes) * 0.5 (1), medium sieving primes are > (1) and
   <= (sieve size in bytes) * 6 (2), and big sieving primes are > (2).
   primesieve uses 3 different algorithms to cross-off multiples:
   EratSmall is optimized for small sieving primes that have many
   multiples in each segment (e.g. 1000), EratMedium is optimized for
   medium sieving primes that have a few multiples per segment
   (e.g. 10) and EratBig is optimized for sieving primes that have
   less than 1 multiple per segment.
