1. I want to generate primes > 2^64. Is it possible to extend
   primesieve to 128 bits?

   Technically it is possible but it makes no sense due to the
   enormous memory requirement. primesieve uses the segmented sieve of
   Eratosthenes which uses O(pi(n^0.5)) memory, thus e.g. near 10^25
   primesieve would need ~ 1300 GB (gigabytes) per thread!

   J. Sorenson's paper "The Pseudosquares Prime Sieve" presents an
   algorithm that can be used to generate primes up to 33 digits
   using very little memory.
