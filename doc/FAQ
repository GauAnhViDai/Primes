1. I want to generate primes > 2^64. Is it possible to extend
   primesieve to 128 bits?

   Technically it is possible but it makes no sense due to the
   enormous memory requirement. primesieve uses the segmented sieve of
   Eratosthenes which uses O(pi(n^0.5)) memory, e.g. near 10^25
   primesieve would need ~ 1300 GB (gigabytes) per thread!
   J. Sorenson's paper "The Pseudosquares Prime Sieve" presents an
   algorithm that can be used to generate primes up to 33 digits
   using very little memory.

2. Does ParallelPrimeSieve::generatePrimes(...) call back primes in
   parallel?

   No, for ease of use prime number generation is synchronized i.e.
   only one thread at a time calls back primes.
   To call back primes in parallel you have to remove the
   synchronization statement: "PrimeSieve::LockGuard lock(ps_);" from
   src/soe/PrimeNumberFinder.cpp.
