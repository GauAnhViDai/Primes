1. About primesieve
===================

  primesieve is a free software program and C++ library that generates
  prime numbers and prime k-tuplets (twins, triplets, ...) < 2^64
  using a highly optimized implementation of the sieve of
  Eratosthenes.

  Homepage: http://primesieve.googlecode.com

2. What's in this source archive
================================

  ./doc - Documentation directory
  -------------------------------
  INSTALL          Explains how to compile primesieve.

                   libprimesieve e.g. for prime number generation.
  Other files:     CHANGES, TODO, BUGS, VALGRIND, ...

  ./src - Source code directory
  -----------------------------

  src/thirdparty   Contains stdint.h (needed for MSVC prior 2010)

3. Requirements
===============

  primesieve is written in C++03, it compiles with every standard
  compliant C++ compiler and runs on both little-endian (x86, x86-64)
  and big-endian (PowerPC, SPARC, ...) CPUs. The parallelization
  (optional) is implemented using OpenMP 3.0 or later.

  Read doc/INSTALL for compilation instructions.

4. Algorithm complexity
=======================

  primesieve uses the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with wheel
  factorization, this algorithm has a complexity of O(n log log n)
  operations and uses O(n^0.5) space.

  primesieve's memory requirement per thread is about:
  pi(n^0.5) * 8 bytes + 400 kilobytes

5. Sieve of Eratosthenes implementation
=======================================

  General information
  -------------------
  The ./src/soe directory contains the sieve of Eratosthenes source
  code. Files that start with a capital letter contain a class of the
  same name, files in lower case contain C-style functions and
  constant definitions. If you are new to prime number sieving I
  recommend reading some of the papers from section 6.

  Quick start
  -----------
  The sieving algorithms are in EratSmall.cpp, EratMedium.cpp and
  EratBig.cpp. The segmented sieve of Eratosthenes is in 
  SieveOfEratosthenes-inline.h. Prime number generation (and counting)
  is done in PrimeNumberFinder.cpp using a macro from GENERATE.h.

  C++ classes in ./src/soe
  ------------------------
  * PrimeSieve & ParallelPrimeSieve (derived from PrimeSieve)
    PrimeSieve objects provide an easy API for prime sieving, the file
    doc/USAGE_EXAMPLES contains a short tutorial.
    PrimeSieve::sieve() starts sieving the primes within the interval
    [start_, stop_], the following classes are all used directly or
    indirectly for sieving.

  * SieveOfEratosthenes (abstract class)
    Implementation of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes using a bit
    array with 30 numbers per byte, each byte of the sieve array holds
    the numbers i*30 + k with k = { 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31 }.
    The main method is SieveOfEratosthenes::sieve(uint_t prime) it
    must be called consecutively for all primes <= sqrt(n) in order to
    sieve the primes up to n. Each sieving prime is first stored in
    one of the Erat(Small|Medium|Big) objects which are then used to
    cross-off the multiples.

  * PrimeNumberFinder (derived from SieveOfEratosthenes)
    Main SieveOfEratosthenes class, used to generate, print and count
    the primes and prime k-tuplets (twins, triplets, ...) within the
    interval [start_, stop_] of the associated PrimeSieve object.

  * PrimeNumberGenerator (derived from SieveOfEratosthenes)
    Generates the primes up to sqrt(n) needed for sieving by the
    PrimeNumberFinder.

  * PreSieve
    PreSieve objects are used to pre-sieve multiples of small primes
    (e.g. <= 19) to speed up the sieve of Eratosthenes.

  * WheelFactorization (abstract class)
    Wheel factorization is used to skip multiples of small primes e.g.
    <= 7 to speed up the sieve of Eratosthenes. The abstract
    WheelFactorization class is used to initialize sieving primes i.e.
    addSievingPrime() calculates the first multiple >= start of each
    sieving prime and the position within the SieveOfEratosthenes
    array of that multiple (multipleIndex). The unsetBit() method is
    used to cross-off a multiple (unset a bit) and to calculate the
    sieving prime's next multiple.

  * EratSmall (derived from WheelFactorization)
    Segmented sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm with a hard-coded
    modulo 30 wheel that skips multiples of 2, 3 and 5. This algorithm
    is optimized for small sieving primes that have many multiples per
    segment. EratSmall is a further optimized implementation of Achim
    Flammenkamp's algorithm.[9]

  * EratMedium (derived from WheelFactorization)
    Segmented sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm with a fixed modulo 210
    wheel that skips multiples of 2, 3, 5 and 7. The wheel is
    implemented using a precomputed lookup table (wheel210 array from
    WheelFactorization.cpp). This algorithm is optimized for medium
    sieving primes with a few multiples per segment.

  * EratBig (derived from WheelFactorization)
    Segmented sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm with Tomás Oliveira's
    improvement for big sieving primes [11] and a fixed modulo 210
    wheel that skips multiples of 2, 3, 5 and 7. The wheel is
    implemented using a precomputed lookup table (wheel210 array from
    WheelFactorization.cpp). EratBig is optimized for big sieving
    primes that have less than one multiple occurrence per segment.

  Other files
  -----------
  * popcount.h
    Contains high performance bit population count algorithms.

  * imath.h
    isqrt(), ilog2(), isquare(), isPowerOf2(), ...

  * GENERATE.h
    Contains macros used to reconstruct primes and prime k-tuplets
    (twins, triplets) from 1 bits of the sieve array.

  * config.h
    Contains constants that set the size of various arrays and limits
    within primesieve. You can set the L1_DCACHE_SIZE and BUCKETSIZE
    constants according to your CPU specifications to get the best
    performance.

6. Further reading
==================

  Jonathan Sorenson's papers provide a good introduction to prime
  number sieves, the sieve of Eratosthenes and segmentation are
  explained in [5], wheel factorization is covered in [6].
  Tomás Oliveira e Silva on his website [11] explains his improvement
  to the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes for big sieving primes.
  A. Járai and E. Vatai's paper "Cache optimized linear sieve" [12]
  explains many of the optimizations used in primesieve.
  Joerg Richstein in [10] (German language) describes how to pre-sieve
  multiples of small primes to speed up the sieve of Eratosthenes.

7. Motivation
=============

  I got my first PC in 1997, it had an Intel 200 mmx CPU and 32
  megabytes of memory. I was 14 years old then and bought the book
  "C++ for Kids" because I wanted to program a computer game and I had
  heard that you could do that in C++ :-) The book contained a trial
  division prime number checker which I found amazing, one entered a
  positive integer and the PC started calculating, after about a
  minute the program printed "is prime" or "is not prime". I soon
  started to invent new faster algorithms ...

8. Thanks
=========

  Thanks to Silver Möls for helping me to further optimize EratBig
  for out-of-order execution of modern CPUs in version 3.1.

  Thanks to Andrey Kulsha for benchmarking new primesieve releases on
  his hexa-core AMD Phenom CPU and also for his help to debug
  primesieve 1.0.
