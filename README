1. Introduction

  primesieve is a highly optimized C++ implementation of the sieve of
  Eratosthenes that finds the prime numbers and prime k-tuplets
  (twin primes, prime triplets, ...) up to 2^64.
  By the date of release primesieve is the fastest publicly available
  sieve of Eratosthenes program (together with YAFU).
  
2. Algorithm and complexity¶

  primesieve uses the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with wheel
  factorization, this algorithm has a complexity of O(n) operations
  and a memory requirement of O(pi(n^0.5)).

  Other optimizations used in primesieve:

    * Pre-elimination of multiples of small primes (<= 19).
    * Dense bit packing (30 numbers per byte).
    * Use of the SSE 4.2 POPCNT instruction for fast bit counting.
    * Uses Tomas Oliveira e Silva's list algorithm for big sieving primes.
    * Parallel, uses multiple processes (Qt GUI version).

3. Build primesieve

  * Console version (Single-Threaded)
    Please refer to the INSTALL file in the current directory.
  
  * Qt GUI version (Multi-Process)
    Please refer to the INSTALL file in the GUI directory.
