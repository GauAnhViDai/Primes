1. Introduction

  primesieve is a highly optimized C++ implementation of the sieve of
  Eratosthenes that finds the prime numbers and prime k-tuplets
  (twin primes, prime triplets, ...) up to 2^64 maximum.
  By the date of release primesieve is the fastest publicly available
  sieve of Eratosthenes implementation (together with YAFU [1]).

2. Algorithm and complexity

  primesieve uses the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with wheel
  factorization, this algorithm has a complexity of O(n) operations
  and a memory requirement of O(pi(sqrt(n))).

  Optimizations used in primesieve:

    * Dense bit packing with 30 numbers per byte
    * Pre-elimination of multiples of small primes (<= 19)
    * Modolo 210 wheel that skips multiples of 2, 3, 5 and 7
    * Uses Tomas Oliveira e Silva's cache-efficient list algorithm for big sieving primes. [2]
    * Uses the SSE 4.2 POPCNT instruction for fast prime counting
    * Parallel, uses multiple processes (Qt GUI version)

3. Build primesieve

  primesieve is written in portable C++ I successfully compiled it
  with 8 different C++ compilers on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
  I maintain two versions:

  * Console version (Single-Threaded)
    Please refer to the INSTALL file in the current directory.

  * Qt GUI version (Multi-Process)
    Please refer to the INSTALL file in the GUI directory.

4. Directories

  * ./GUI
    Contains a graphical user interface front end for PrimeSieve. The
    GUI has been created with Qt4 (Qt is a C++ cross-platform
    application and UI framework by nokia).

  * ./src
    Contains the sieve of Eratosthenes implementation.

5. Sieve of Eratosthenes documentation (./src directory)

  * src/PrimeSieve.cpp
    Main object, provides an easy to use user interface for prime
    sieving. Have a look at src/main.cpp to see how it works.
    PrimeSieve implements directly or indirectly all the following
    classes.

  * src/SieveOfEratosthenes.cpp
    Abstract sieve of Eratosthenes class, PrimeNumberGenerator and
    PrimeNumberFinder are derived from SieveOfEratosthenes.
    SieveOfEratosthenes uses the following 3 Erat* algorithms for
    prime sieving.

  * src/EratSmall
    Implementation of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with wheel
    factorization optimized for small sieving primes.
    Uses a hardcoded modulo 30 wheel. EratSmall is a further optimized
    implementation of Achim Flammenkamp's algorithm. [3]

  * src/EratMedium
    Implementation of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with wheel
    factorization optimized for medium sieving primes.
    Uses a dynamic modulo 210 wheel.

  * src/EratBig
    Implementation of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with wheel
    factorization optimized for big sieving primes.
    Uses a dynamic modulo 210 wheel in conjunction with Tomas Oliveira
    e Silva's cache-efficient list algorithm. [2]

  * src/PrimeNumberGenerator.cpp
    Generates the prime numbers up to sqrt(stopNumber) needed for
    sieving by PrimeNumberFinder.

  * src/PrimeNumberFinder.cpp
    Main SieveOfEratosthenes object, used to count and print prime
    numbers and prime k-tuplets.

  * src/ResetSieve.cpp
    ResetSieve is used to reset the sieve array (resets the bits to 1)
    of SieveOfEratosthenes after each sieve round. ResetSieve also
    pre-eliminates multiples of small primes (<= 19).

  * src/settings.h
    Contains compile-time constants that set the size of various
    arrays within primesieve. The values are optimized for CPUs with
    32 to 64 KiloBytes of L1 Data Cache.

  * src/WheelFactorization.h
    Contains data structures related to wheel factorization. Wheel
    factorization is used to skip multiples of small primes (i.e. a
    modulo 30 wheel skips multiples of 2, 3 and 5).
