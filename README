1. About
========

  primesieve is a highly optimized C++ implementation of the sieve of
  Eratosthenes that generates primes and prime k-tuplets (twin primes,
  prime triplets, ...) up to 2^64 maximum.
  
  Visit: http://primesieve.googlecode.com

2. Algorithm and Complexity
===========================

  primesieve uses the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with wheel
  factorization, this algorithm has a complexity of O(n log log n)
  operations and uses O(n^0.5) space.

  Sorenson's papers provide a good introduction to prime number
  sieves, wheels are described in [5] and the segmented sieve of
  Eratosthenes in [6].

3. Memory Usage
===============

PrimeSieve::sieve() uses about:
pi(n^0.5) * 8 Bytes + 500 Kilobytes              (1)

ParallelPrimeSieve::sieve() uses about:
(1) * number of threads                          (2)

4. Source Archive
=================

  primesieve is written in portable C++, I successfully compiled it
  with 8 different C++ compilers on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X (x86,
  x86-64 and PowerPC).

  Source Code Directories
  -----------------------
  src/soe         Contains the sieve of Eratosthenes implementation.
  src/console     Contains the primesieve console application.

  and use the primesieve console application.
  The file src/qt-gui/INSTALL explains how to compile the primesieve
  Qt GUI application.

5. Sieve of Eratosthenes Implementation (src/soe directory)
===========================================================

  General Information
  -------------------

  The following file descriptions give an overview of how everything
  fits together, files that start with a capital letter contain a
  class of the same name. The source code is also documented, header
  files contain the class and variable descriptions, .cpp files
  contain the function descriptions.

  Files
  -----

  * PrimeSieve.cpp and ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp (uses OpenMP)
    PrimeSieve objects provide an easy API for prime sieving, the file
    docs/USAGE_EXAMPLES contains a short tutorial.
    PrimeSieve::sieve() starts sieving, the following classes are all
    used directly or indirectly for sieving.

  * SieveOfEratosthenes.cpp (abstract class)
    Implementation of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes using a bit
    array with 30 numbers per byte. Each byte of the sieve array holds
    the numbers i * 30 + k with k = {7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31}, 
    this byte arrangement is convenient for prime k-tuplet sieving.
    The main function is SieveOfEratosthenes::sieve(uint32_t) it must
    be called consecutively for all prime numbers up to n^0.5 in order
    to sieve the primes up to n. Each sieving prime is first added to
    one of the following three Erat* objects which are used to cross
    off the multiples.

  * EratSmall.cpp
    Implementation of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with a
    hard-coded modulo 30 wheel (skips multiples of 2, 3 and 5). The
    algorithm is optimized for small sieving primes that have a lot of
    multiple occurrences per segment. EratSmall is a further optimized
    implementation of Achim Flammenkamp's algorithm.[7]

  * EratMedium.cpp
    Implementation of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with a fixed
    modulo 210 wheel (skips multiples of 2, 3, 5 and 7). The wheel is
    implemented using the Modulo210Wheel::wheel_ array from
    WheelFactorization.cpp. This algorithm is faster than EratSmall
    for sieving primes that have only a few multiple occurrences per
    segment.

  * EratBig.cpp
    Uses the same algorithm as EratMedium in conjunction with Tomas
    Oliveira e Silva's cache-friendly list algorithm.[9]
    EratBig is optimized for sieving primes that have less than one
    multiple occurrence per segment.

  * PrimeNumberGenerator.cpp (derived from SieveOfEratosthenes)
    Generates the prime numbers up to n^0.5 needed for sieving by
    PrimeNumberFinder. Used in PrimeSieve::sieve()

  * PrimeNumberFinder.cpp (derived from SieveOfEratosthenes)
    Counts, prints and generates the primes up to n. PrimeNumberFinder
    is initialized in PrimeSieve::sieve() and is used in
    PrimeNumberGenerator::generate(const uint8_t*, uint32_t)

  * PreSieve.cpp
    PreSieve objects are used to pre-sieve multiples of small primes
    (e.g. <= 19) to speed up the sieve of Eratosthenes.
    Used in SieveOfEratosthenes::sieve(uint32_t)

  * defs.h
    Contains macro definitions and constants that set the size of
    various arrays and limits within primesieve. The constants have
    been optimized for my Intel Core i5-670 3.46GHz (2 x 32 KB L1 Data
    Cache, 2 x 256 L2 Cache, 4 MB L3 Cache) from 2010.

  * WheelFactorization.h
    Contains classes and structs related to wheel factorization. Wheel
    factorization is used to skip multiples of small primes. The
    abstract ModuloWheel class is used to initialize sieving primes,
    ModuloWheel::getWheelPrimeData(...) calculates the first
    multiple >= startNumber_ of each sieving prime. The sieving prime
    is then stored together with a sieveIndex (position of the next
    multiple within the sieve array) and a wheelIndex as a WheelPrime
    object, these objects are used by EratSmall, EratMedium and
    EratBig to cross off the multiples.

6. Final Thoughts
=================

  Parallelization
  ---------------

  My tries to parallelize the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes using
  real parallelism (i.e. without increasing memory usage) resulted in
  a run time worse than single-threaded. Therefore in
  ParallelPrimeSieve each thread sieves chunks of the interval
  [startNumber, stopNumber] using PrimeSieve objects until the entire
  interval has been processed. This approach scales well on multi-core
  CPUs but the memory usage depends on the number of threads i.e.
  O(n^0.5) * threads, and the primes are not generated or printed in
  order.

  Prime k-tuplets (twin primes, ...)
  ----------------------------------

  primesieve has been written for fast prime number generation, at the
  same speed it can also generate twin primes, prime triplets, ...
  One user made me aware of an algorithm specialised for twin prime
  sieving, the idea is published at:
  http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Primes/twin.html
  This algorithm can be generalised to prime k-tuplets (triplets,
  quadruplets, quintuplets, ...) resulting in a faster and more
  efficient algorithm, especially if k grows.
