New in version 2.2, 06/05/2011
==============================

1. Added two new member functions to soe/PrimeSieve.
  + getPrimes(uint64_t, uint64_t, void (*callback)(uint64_t))
    calls a callback function for each generated prime number.
  + getPrimeCount(uint64_t, uint64_t)
    convenience function that counts prime numbers.
2. The thread interface of ParallelPrimeSieve has been simplified.
3. Updated documentation of Primesieve.h, ParallelPrimeSieve.h

New in version 2.1, 11/04/2011
==============================

1. Release of primesieve 2.1 GUI version.
  + fixes start number bug (see BUGS file).
  + supports integer arithmetic expressions as number input.
  + uses threads (OpenMP) instead of processes.
  + added qt-gui/README file.
2. Fixes bug in Makefile when using the LLVM compiler.
3. Updated README file.

New in version 2.0, 15/02/2011
==============================

1. Added soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp which counts primes in parallel
   using OpenMP.
2. Added an arithmetic expression parser (./expr) to ease number input.
3. Added a test suite to the console version of primesieve
   (option: -test) which runs various correctness tests.
4. The console version has been reviewed and is first released.
5. Fixed a minor bug in soe/PrimeNumberFinder.cpp which counts and
   prints the prime preceding the start number (see BUGS file).
6. Improved the memory pool of soe/EratBig.cpp, primesieve 1.0 ran
   into trouble when sieving near 2^64.
7. Makefile modified to better support GCC compatible compilers,
   e.g. make CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
