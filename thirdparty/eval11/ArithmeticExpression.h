/**
 * @file ArithmeticExpression.h
 * @brief This is a wrapper class for Parsifal's Arithmetic Expression
 *        Evaluator <www.parsifalsoft.com> which is written in C and
 *        has been generated by their AnaGram parser.
 * @author Kim Walisch <kim.walisch@gmail.com>
 *
 * Their Readme files says:
 * >> evaluateExpression may be freely copied and modified.
 *
 * CHANGES:
 *
 * I polished the C from 1999 for use in my C++ project
 * <http://primesieve.googlecode.com>. These are the major
 * modifications I have made in evaldefs.h, evalkern.h, evalkern.c and
 * evalwrap.c:
 *
 * 1. Use of extern "C" for usage in C++ project
 * 2. double changed to uint64_t (better precision near 1e19) type
 *    from stdint.h
 * 3. Uninitialized variables are set to UINT64_MAX instead
 *    of 0
 * 4. Removed use of strdup (not ANSI) and sprintf (causes 
 *    unsafe warnings)
 * 5. Added a current pointer which points to the last used
 *    variable
 * 6. Added (char*) cast for strings to silence warnings
 * 7. Unused file evaldemo.c has been renamed to evaldemo.c.unused
 *
 * NOTE:
 *
 * The original source archive can be obtained from:
 * http://www.parsifalsoft.com/examples/evalexpression/index.html
 *
 * EXAMPLES of valid expressions:
 *
 * "3+5"                            = 8
 * "2**32"                          = 4294967296
 * "1e18+1e10"                      = 1000000010000000000
 * "23*5+(7*2**32/(1e18%555))"      = 67561398
 * "x = 333"                        = 333
 * "sqrt( 10**14 )"                 = 10000000
 * "(5 < 8) ?1 :1e10+2**32"         = 1
 * "2 ** 2 ** (0+2 *2+1)"            = 4294967296
 *
 * @warning As 64 bit unsigned integers are used for all calculations
 *          one has to be careful with divisions:
 *          i.e. (10/6)*10 = 10
 *          and negative numbers:
 *          i.e. -100 = 18446744073709551516
 *          but -100+1e10 = 9999999900 is OK
