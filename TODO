What needs to be done
=====================

1. Port the GUI version of primesieve to version 2.0

2. Once C++0x (thread_local) is widely supported
  All global variables and "static const" member variables within the
  ./soe directory should be declared either "static const thread_local"
  or simply const with initialization in the constructor initializer
  list. This seems to be more correct from a theoretical point of view
  if multi-threading is used.
