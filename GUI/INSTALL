How to build primesieve (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux):

  1. Download and install Qt
    Qt is a C++ cross-platform application and UI framework that is
	maintained by nokia and available under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
	LICENSE. primesieve has been developed with Qt4 and requires Qt
	4.4 or above.
	Download and install the latest version of the Qt SDK from:
	http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
	Old versions can be obtained from (once Qt4 is not supported
	anymore):
	ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/
	
  2. Launch the Qt-primesieve.pro file with Qt-Creator (cross-platform
    C++ integrated development environment which is part of the Qt
	SDK). Set the build settings according to Qt-Creator-settings.jpg
	and then run "Build All" or "Run".

Remarks:

  1. The best performance is achieved with Microsoft Visual C++ (needs
    "Visual Studio Add-in" for Qt) or the GNU Compiler Suite, G++.
	MinGW offers poor performance. 

  2. SSE 4.2 POPCNT (bit population count CPU instruction)
    primesieve counts prime numbers faster if it is compiled with
	POPCNT support. SSE 4.2 is enabled by default for Microsoft Visual
	C++ but has to be enabled explicitly for GNU G++ (>= 4.4) with:
	-mpopcnt or -msse4.2
	
  3. The compiled primesieve executable depends on the QtGui4 and
    QtCore4 libraries (Windows: .dll, Unix: .lib). If you want to run
	the executable on other PCs you have to copy these libraries to
	the primesieve executable directory.
