New in version 2.2, 26/05/2011
==============================

1. Added the file docs/USAGE_EXAMPLES which shows how to use
   PrimeSieve and ParallelPrimeSieve objects.
2. Fixed 4 minor bugs (see BUGS).
3. 10% initialization speedup due to enhancement in
   ModuloWheel::setWheelPrime(uint64_t, uint32_t*, uint32_t*, uint32_t*)
4. Added prime number generation functions and a convenience function
   to count prime numbers to PrimeSieve.
5. The thread interface of ParallelPrimeSieve has been simplified.
6. The code now compiles and runs with the sunCC compiler.
7. The code readability has been improved.
8. The documentation has been updated.

New in version 2.1, 11/04/2011
==============================

1. Release of primesieve 2.1 GUI version.
   + fixes start number bug (see BUGS file).
   + supports integer arithmetic expressions as number input.
   + uses threads (OpenMP) instead of processes.
   + added qt-gui/README file.
2. Fixes bug in Makefile when using the LLVM compiler.
3. Updated README file.

New in version 2.0, 15/02/2011
==============================

1. Added soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp which counts primes in parallel
   using OpenMP.
2. Added an arithmetic expression parser (./expr) to ease number input.
3. Added a test suite to the console version of primesieve
   (option: -test) which runs various correctness tests.
4. The console version has been reviewed and is first released.
5. Fixed a minor bug in soe/PrimeNumberFinder.cpp which counts and
   prints the prime preceding the start number (see BUGS file).
6. Improved the memory pool of soe/EratBig.cpp, primesieve 1.0 ran
   into trouble when sieving near 2^64.
7. Makefile modified to better support GCC compatible compilers,
   e.g. make CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
