New in version 2.2, 23/05/2011
==============================

1. Added prime number generation functions to soe/PrimeSieve.
   + void PrimeSieve::generatePrimes(uint64_t, uint64_t, void (*)(uint64_t))
     calls a callback function for each generated prime number.
   + void PrimeSieve::generatePrimes(uint64_t, uint64_t, void (*)(uint64_t, void*), void*)
     calls an OOP style callback function for each prime number.
2. Added a convenience function to count prime numbers.
   + uint64_t PrimeSieve::getPrimeCount(uint64_t, uint64_t)
3. The thread interface of ParallelPrimeSieve has been simplified.
4. Fixed 2 bugs (see BUGS).
5. Updated documentation.
6. Code has been reviewed, some cleanup.

New in version 2.1, 11/04/2011
==============================

1. Release of primesieve 2.1 GUI version.
   + fixes start number bug (see BUGS file).
   + supports integer arithmetic expressions as number input.
   + uses threads (OpenMP) instead of processes.
   + added qt-gui/README file.
2. Fixes bug in Makefile when using the LLVM compiler.
3. Updated README file.

New in version 2.0, 15/02/2011
==============================

1. Added soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp which counts primes in parallel
   using OpenMP.
2. Added an arithmetic expression parser (./expr) to ease number input.
3. Added a test suite to the console version of primesieve
   (option: -test) which runs various correctness tests.
4. The console version has been reviewed and is first released.
5. Fixed a minor bug in soe/PrimeNumberFinder.cpp which counts and
   prints the prime preceding the start number (see BUGS file).
6. Improved the memory pool of soe/EratBig.cpp, primesieve 1.0 ran
   into trouble when sieving near 2^64.
7. Makefile modified to better support GCC compatible compilers,
   e.g. make CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
