I consider primesieve stable now. I may implement the following TODOs
in a few years when C++11 is widely supported.

1. Use smart pointers (std::unique_ptr) for dynamic memory allocation.
2. Use unsigned int or auto instead of uint32_t where appropriate.
3. use <cstdint> instead of <stdint.h>
4. Use nullptr instead of NULL.
5. src/soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp is currently not exception safe when
   >= 2 threads are used due to lack of C++ exception support in
   OpenMP (February 2012).
6. Once OpenMP supports array reduction I should use it in
   src/soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp.
