C++11
-----

I may implement the following TODOs in a few years when C++11 is
widely supported.

1. Use smart pointers (std::unique_ptr) for dynamic memory allocation.
2. Use auto and decltype where appropriate.
3. Use <cstdint> instead of <stdint.h>.
4. Use nullptr instead of NULL (remove <cstdlib> header).

OpenMP
------

1. ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp is currently not exception safe when >= 2
   threads are used due to lack of C++ exception support in OpenMP 3.1
   (May 2012), OpenMP 4 may support C++ exceptions.
2. Once OpenMP supports array reduction I should use it in
   ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp.
